== Overview

This project is a comprehensive example of building an end-to-end pipeline on Snowflake to ingest data through OpenFlow, transform it using dbt Projects for Standard models, Semantic Views, Cortex Search, and Cortex Agents for AI-powered automation, batch analytics, and conversational AI through Snowflake Intelligence.

[IMPORTANT]
*To demonstrate this stack, the project uses incident management as an illustrative subset of the real-world business process only to show the art of possible with this modern design pattern on Snowflake that can be applied for any industry or business process.*

=== Key Features

. *Open new data frontiers* to ingest from using OpenFlow connectors

. *Standardize data models* using SQL and well-established engineering tools like dbt core

. *Interleave AISQL* within dbt models for dynamic reasoning and decision-making
+
* This includes using AISQL to process unstructured text and images for classification and enrichment
* Or, unstructured documents (PDFs, PPTs, TXTs, etc.) for search and retrieval, and question extraction

. *Deploy Cortex services*, such as Cortex Search and Cortex Agents, from within the same dbt Project

. *Unlock conversational AI* through Snowflake Intelligence for decision-making through all data within a business process
